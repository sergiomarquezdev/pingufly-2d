## Development Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Maintain 60 FPS on both desktop and mobile devices
- Use simplified physics calculations for mobile
- Implement adaptive quality settings based on device capabilities
- Monitor memory usage, especially for long gameplay sessions

### Technical Reminders
- Use Phaser's WebGL renderer with Canvas fallback
- Implement efficient object pooling for projectiles and particles
- Keep draw calls under 20 per frame for optimal mobile performance
- Use sprite atlases instead of individual image files
- Ensure consistent delta time usage in update methods
- Properly destroy and clean up resources when changing scenes

### Milestone Check Criteria
- Core gameplay must be responsive and intuitive
- Character animations must be smooth and visually appealing
- Flight physics must feel satisfying and consistent
- UI elements must be clear and accessible on all screen sizes
- Game must maintain stable performance across target devices

This timeline serves as a guideline and may need adjustment as development progresses. Regular testing should be performed throughout each phase to ensure quality and performance targets are being met.
