---
- Use proper asset organization with subdirectories for different asset types (images, audio, etc.)
- Implement texture atlases and sprite sheets for related images
- Optimize image sizes and formats (use WebP where supported)
- Use appropriate audio formats with fallbacks (MP3, OGG)
- Implement progressive and background loading for large assets
- Properly release unused assets to free memory
- Consider different asset versions for different device capabilities
- Use meaningful, consistent naming conventions for all assets
