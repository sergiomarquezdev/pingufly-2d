- Implement touch controls and gestures optimized for mobile devices (Phaser Input events)
- Use responsive design techniques to adapt the game UI for various screen sizes and orientations (Phaser Scale Manager)
- Optimize asset quality and size for mobile devices to reduce load times and conserve bandwidth
- Implement efficient power management techniques (consider pausing or reducing activity when the game is not in focus)
- Utilize browser APIs for accessing native device features if necessary (e.g., vibration)
- Consider using the Canvas renderer on older mobile devices if WebGL performance is an issue (Phaser Renderer configuration)
