- Follow Phaser's Scene lifecycle methods (init, preload, create, update)
- Keep preload methods focused only on asset loading
- Use create for scene setup and initialization
- Implement clean update methods that avoid unnecessary calculations
- Properly destroy and clean up resources when changing scenes
- Use scene manager for handling scene transitions
- Implement pause/resume functionality appropriately
- Consider scene composition for complex game states
