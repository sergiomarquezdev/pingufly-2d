# Performance Optimization
- Minimize object creation during gameplay to reduce garbage collection pauses
- Implement efficient particle systems using libraries or Three.js's Points and custom shaders for complex visual effects
- Use texture atlases or texture arrays to reduce texture swaps and improve rendering performance
- Implement level streaming or chunking for large game worlds to manage memory usage
- Optimize asset loading with progressive loading techniques and asset compression (e.g., using Draco compression for geometries)
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations and game loop management
- Be mindful of the complexity of your scene and optimize render order
- Use smaller, low-res textures for older mobile devices
- Implement proper bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) for efficient spatial queries like raycasting
- Use caching for all the data that is needed multiple times
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- Use pre-fetching for critical data and assets
