description: Guidelines for managing dependencies and external libraries in Phaser games
globs: /package.json
---
- Carefully evaluate the need for external libraries or plugins (Phaser plugins from the community)
- When choosing external dependencies, consider:
    - Performance impact on game
    - Compatibility with target platforms
    - Active maintenance and community support
    - Documentation quality
    - Ease of integration and future upgrades
- If using native plugins (e.g., for sound or device features), handle them within Phaser's plugin system
