# Dependencies and External Libraries
- Carefully evaluate the need for external libraries or plugins (e.g., physics engines like Cannon.js or Ammo.js, animation libraries)
- When choosing external dependencies, consider:
  - Performance impact on game
  - Compatibility with target platforms
  - Active maintenance and community support
  - Documentation quality
  - Ease of integration and future upgrades
- If using native plugins (e.g., for sound or device features), handle them in a centralized service
