# Testing and Quality Assurance
- Implement performance profiling and monitoring tools to identify bottlenecks (e.g., using the browser's performance tools or Three.js's stats)
- Use cross-device testing to ensure consistent performance across platforms
- Implement error logging and crash reporting for easier debugging in production
- Be aware of browser-specific issues and implement appropriate workarounds
- Write comprehensive unit tests for game logic and systems
- Implement integration tests for game scenes and major features
- Create automated performance tests to catch regressions
- Use mocks for external services or APIs
- Implement playtesting tools and analytics for gameplay balance and user experience testing
- Set up automated builds and testing in the CI/CD pipeline
- Use global error and alert handlers
- Integrate a crash reporting service for the application
