globs: /src/**/*.{js,ts}
---
- Organize code into modular components: game engine (Phaser instance), scene management (Phaser Scenes), entity systems (custom classes or ECS patterns)
- Implement a robust state management system for game progression and save states
- Use design patterns appropriate for game development (e.g., Observer for event handling, Factory for object creation, State for game modes)
