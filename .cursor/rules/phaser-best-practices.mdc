- Leverage JavaScript's dynamic typing, but consider using JSDoc for better code understanding and tooling
- Use Phaser best practices for rendering and object pooling to minimize garbage collection
- Implement efficient asset loading and management techniques using Phaser's Loader
- Utilize Phaser's WebGL renderer for optimal performance on supported browsers, falling back to Canvas for broader compatibility
- Implement proper game loop using Phaser's Scene update method for consistent updates and rendering
