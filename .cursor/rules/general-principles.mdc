description: Key principles for JavaScript and Phaser game development
globs: /**/*.js
---
- Write concise, technically accurate JavaScript code with a focus on performance
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes unless necessary for Phaser specific implementations
- Prioritize code optimization and efficient resource management for smooth gameplay
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasRendered)
- Structure files logically: game components, scenes, utilities, assets management, and types (or JSDoc for typing)
